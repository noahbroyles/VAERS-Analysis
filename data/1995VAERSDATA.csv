There was no concomitant therapy. On 09-JUN-1995 at 17:00 PM the patient developed a papular rash on the back that consisted of four to five non-vesicular lesions. The lesions persisted over a twenty-four hour period. In follow-up, the physician reported that over the next one to two weeks, the child developed continuous outbreaks of one to two non-vesicular, non-pruritic lesions at a time. The child continued to go to daycare and exposed other non-vaccinated children who had no history of having had chicken pox, and there was no secondary transmission. The patient was not ill at the time of vaccination and there was no relevent laboratory or diagnostic tests performed. On 20-JUN-1995, the child recovered without treatment. Additional follow-up received from the patient's mother, a physician, reported that her child received the chickenpox vaccine and had ""breakout"" in second grade (approximately 2000).
