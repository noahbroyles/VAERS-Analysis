We explained everything that had been ocurring. He was very questionable about exactly what was occuring. He examined him and recommended we take him to a Pediatric Neurologist. He also ordered an immediate blood work-up. They tested him for many substances such as lead, chromium etc. Everything came out clear. He set us up with a neurologist. He said he couldn't see our son for over a month. We were extremely distraught. We argued over the severity of what was occuring. They said it was the best they could do. So we waited. Over this period of time our son deteriorated severly. He continued twitching, jerking, spasming. He could not even walk without falling. He lost his entire memory. He was like he was in a delierium. He would just sit and stare at a blank wall. He no longer recognized anything or anyone around him. He began urinating and soiling himself on a regular basis. He basically became like a vegatable. We called the doctor and pleaded for help. We were told we must wait. That there were other sick children too. This was the most horrible, stressful, sad experience in our lives. Our son could no longer talk at all. he had no memory of anything including his father and I. He had no potty training abilities. He had no co-ordination. He could barely walk. He would just sit and stare with his mouth open. After about 3 continuous weeks of twitiching it stopped. But his condition had no improvement. He became terrifed of anything. Screaming and crying uncontrollably. After about a week wait we finally got him to the neurologist. Upon him seeing and hearing our son. He says ""why was this child not brought to my attention much sooner."" We nearly went into hysterics. Explaining all we had been through and how hard we tried to get him in. He became upset and said he wished to speak to our sons pediatrition. So we agreed. He spoke to the doctor about him recognizing this as a DPT reaction. Why was this not brought to his attention sooner to begin treatment. Our sons pediatrition; said he just wasn't sure about the DPT reaction. He said he had observed some abnormal behaviors in our son before immunization; he thought it might relate to. We found this comment rude, offensive and a deliberate move to try and cover his huge mistakes. He had never brought any concerns about our son to our attention ever. He was his pediatrition since birth. He always commended us on his growth and advancements. Nothing but positive remarks. To hear this was infuriating. The neurologist asked for immediate admittance into the hospital. We agreed to this. He was admitted to the hospital. They did an MRI and a Spinal Tap. Both of the tests came back normal. The Neurologist said that our son had aquired an aphasia for a reason still unknown. So we should get an EEG The EEg should be sleeping. This was a problem because since all this occurred our son had become extremly hyper-active, rarely sleeping, he had constant laughing seizures which lasted for up to 3 hours. He was uncontrollable. We still tried the EEG. We could not get him to settle much less sleep for the test. The results were not showing seizure activity. The neurologist recommended taking him to a psycologist for evaluation. We agreed and upon doing so both evaluations brought up a possiblity of him aquiring a rare condition called Landau Kleffner Syndrome. They believed he was still having sub-clinical seziures. Which was causing the strange behaviors now occuring hyper-activity, social withdrawl, aggressiveness, depression etc. We felt it was because of the complete loss of speech and language and memory. That caused such tremdous frustration. During all this process the insurance company had refused to pay the medical bills for our son. They said that our son had been adversly affected by immunization. Therefore we needed to sue in this matter. We needed to sign a lein form stating that the insurance company would be reimbursed for any and all payments made by them from the date of his injury on. If we were to receive a settlement. We were more stressed and confused. Medical bills mounting, still no answers for our sons deterioration. We contacted a lawyer to see about getting the insurance to pay the bills they were legally liable to pay. In this process the lawyer had to obtain medical records and billing statements from all involved in his treatment. At this time our son had reached a level of unbelievable out of control aggression. Our entire family was crying and worried. We finally decided to see his pediatrition again about the problem. He prescribed PROZAC for our son. We agreed and administered the medication. Our sons behaviors did come under better control. But he could still not talk or even think clearly. We were taking him to a speech pathologist to help him. The neurologist he was seeing had requested we get another MRI and a sleeping 24hr. EEG, and a PET scan. We had accomplished a second MRI when he received papers from the attorney. He then became beligerant and seemed unwilling to help us further. We were devastated and explained we were only trying to get the insurance to pay our bills. He was rude and did not believe us. He said some very rude remarks and refused to run tests on our son. We then learned from the psycologist we were taking our son to see that his pediatrition had been saying very rude remarks about our son to the psycologist and other care givers. After he received attorney papers on our sons behalf. He was suddenly telling people that he always saw our son as ""A weird kid"" to quote him. This was the last thing we could tolerate from him. We refused to ever take our son to him ever again. We asked all the people in the process of helping him to no longer send any reports or Information to doctor. We were so worried and lost at this point. His pediatrition since birth was no longer available. Our son was still so sick and disturbed. We had no answers or help to get our boy back. Everyone had felt that these new disturbing behaviors were probably causedby sub-clinical seizures. We searched for a while and heard about a really good child psychiatrist who diagnosed and dealth with children having many symptoms like our son. So we took him to seem him. Immediately upon examing him he felt we also were dealing with sub-clinical seizures. He ordered a spect scan for our son. Which was scheduled as soon as possible. When he received the spect scan it showed he was definatly still having sub-clinical seizures. He had been experiencing them every since he had received his DPT. Because of the extended period of time he had suffered from these severe seizures in his front temporal lobes. This had caused the memory loss. The loss of speech. The odd behaviors such as huge mood swings. Now we know that our damage to both his left and right front temporal lobes. The thing that saddens us the most is that we know the damage could have been much less if he had gotten immediate attention and diagnosis like we basically begged for. Now he goes through extensive speech and language therapy. We work with him constantly he is making much progress. But he is a completely different child now. He has such a hard time with the simplist of tasks. he is on medicinal therapy form the psychiatrist. He has to take DepaKene for seizure control. The damage to his brain has also caused him to now have two other disorders diagnosedone is called ADHD or attention deficit hyper-activity disorder. Which he has to take a medication for. The other disorder is called OCD or obsessive compulsive disorder. Which he has to take a third medication for. Our lives have been turned upside down. It is so difficult; but we love him dearly and will continue to do what we can to help him",,,,Y,Y,3,,Y,N,04/08/1998,04/21/1998,13,"2MRI's, 1 spinal tap, 1EEG, 1 spect scan,  1 extensive blood workup",UNK,UNK,NONE,NONE,NONE,,,1,,,,,

This is in follow-up to report(s) previously submitted on 5/21/99. Information has been received from a registered nurse concerning a 12-month-old male with a medical history of sensitive skin and aquagenic urticaria, who on 11-Aug-1998 was vaccinated SC with the first dose of MMR II in the right arm. Concomitant vaccinations that same day included the first dose of VARIVAX. On 20-Aug-1998 the patient developed a fever and a bilateral rash on his calves. On approximately 26-Aug-1998 the patient developed a rash on his arm and by 28-AUG-1998 the patient had developed a lacy raised rash on both calves. The patient was also noted as being fussy. The rash persisted through 03-OCT-1998 and the patient was then evaluated by a dermatologist. Follow-up information received from a physician indicated on 22-AUG-1998 the patient developed a fever for two days. He also developed a rash on his calves. On 28-AUG-1998 the patient developed a fever x 1 day and the rash spread to his arms and was described as raised and blanched. On 01-SEP-1998 the patient was noted as being very fussy with faint localized petechia and was treated with ADVIL. On 28-SEP-1998 a lacy, raised rash was noted on both calves and was non-tender and blanched. Therapy with ELOCON was initiated. The patient was also noted as developing a runny nose and cough x 3 days. On 03-OCT-1998 the rash was on the legs and arms and was noted as purple and red. The patient was then referred to a dermatologist. Information received from the dermatologist indicated from medical notes on 06-OCT-1998 ""probable Henoch-Schonlein purpura associated with vaccination. Consider atypical erythema multiforme or even a very unusual granuloma annulare. Patient should be worked up for any organ involvement associated with Henoch-Schonlein purpura, particularly renal disease, although he is asymptomatic at present. Biopsy not performed today because of the age of the child and inability to cooperate with procedure. Suggest a trail of BENADRYL every night at bed time to see if urticarial component of this dermatitis may be reduced. Consider biopsy if dermatitis continues to progress and patient becomes symptomatic."" Medical notes from 17-NOV-1998 indicated a diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia, follicular pattern of biopsy. In December, 1998 the patient was noted to have recovered.

She does not talk and understands very little. All medication has failed. Follow-up information received 12-JUL-2002 identified and further described the patient's adverse events. Followiing clarification of the source documents, the primary suspect vaccine was changed from Tri-Immunol to Tetramune. A mother reported that her 4-month-old daughter who had developed a respiratory syncytial viral infection (following immunization with ""RSV"" (manufacturer unknown vaccine) and was treated with an unspecified medication at the end of December 1996, received her second doses of Tatramune and IPV vaccines on 20-JAN-1997. According to the patient's grandmother, the patient was seen by the physician for persistent RSV symptoms that day. The patient was afebrile and immunization were administered. Shortly therafter, the patient was taken to her grandmother's home where she reportedly experienced inconsolable, high-pitched screamint. Her legs had ""doubled in size"" and she pulled her legs up, as if in pain. Her crying resolved 5 hours later, she slept. Following these events, the patient had sleep disturbances and her sleeping pattern was ""horrible"". The patient now cried inconsolably for long periods of time and her eyes seemed ""totally different, like someone scared."" She was lethargic and id not ""respond as before."" Her mother reported that she did not recognize anyone; her personality slight jerking movements. A physician's appointment was made. That night, her jerking and crying worsened and she was taken to the emergency room. A diagnosis of colic was made. The physician's appointment was canceled; however, a short time later, the patient was requested to be seen in the office as soon as possible. Unspecified blood work was performed and the patient was admitted to the hosptial on 03-FEB-1997. An EEG was performed and a diagnosis of infantile spasms was made. The patient was treated with adrenocortiotropic hormone following her recovery from RSV. Numerous procedures and tests were performed including an MRI scan, ""Spec"" scan, lumbar puncture, CAT scan and metabolic and genetic testing. Results were not provided. According to the patient's grandmother, ""nothing shows up"". She was prescribed a ketogenic diet and has had a vague nerve stimulator inserted. She has been treted with unspecified medications. As of 24-APR-2001, the patient can walk and sit up. She cannot talk, and cognitively, she is 6 months of age. The patient is incontinent and cannot feed herself with a spoon. The patient has 20 to 100 seizures per day. The grandmother indicated that the treating physician did not think the patient would progress any further than she has. The patient's ""eyes and brain do not work correctly."" Her daughter was ""braindamaged."" This report was directly submitted to VAERS by the reporter.

That same day, the patient experienced a ""slightly stuffy runny nose (thought to be drooling)."" On 07-FEB-1998 he was ""fuzzy all day and had cold-like symptoms"".

It was reported that three never seemed to bother him and never scabbed over but just faded away. On 28-FEB-1998 an additional spot appeared in the patient's rectum which really irritated him and it bled a tiny bit when using wet wipes during diaper changes. By 01-MAR-1998 the spot on his back was still pretty bad looking and his grandmother thought it resembled a boil and should be checked in case he was fighting something internal. On 02-MAR-1998 the patient was seen by a physician who did not consider chickenpox since the patient had the vaccine and the spots looked remarkably better. The physician thought the spots may have been just bug bites but prescribed Cefzil 250 mg for fluid in the ear which would also clear up anything else he might have had.

Information has been received from a health care porfesional concerning a 4 year old female patient who on 05-Jun-1998 was vaccinated with the first dose of VARIVAX. 0.5 ml in the left arm. Subsequently the patient developed herpes roster, with clusters of vesicles on the left arm, left hand and left side. As of 05-Aug-1998 the patient had no new lesions. On 06-Aug-1998 the patient presented for a follow up visit. The rash was described as ""very strange and unusual"". The patient had a ""big vesicle"" on her palm, and several additional clusters of vesicles on the inside of her arm extending to the elbow. Once the clusters reached the elbow area, the line of clusters began to wrap around the arm, and wre located on the back side of the upper arm. The patient also had some dry lesions on the left side of her neck and lower back.

This is an follow-up to report(s) previously submitted on 5/14/1999. Information has been received from a health care professional concerning a 5-year-old male patient who in 1998 was vaccinated with one dose of VARIVAX. Approximately ten days following vaccination, the patient experienced a rash (time frame unknown) and was eventually hospitalized with VZV pneumonia. At the time of the report, the patient was on a ventilator in the PICU. It was reported that in approximately 17-NOV-1998, DFA analysis of endotracheal secretions was done for CMV, HSV, flu A and B and RSV, all of which were negative; however, DFA for VZV was ""strongly positive."" In addition, specimens were ""negative for sycoplasm IgM."" Additional information received indicated that in approximately 17-NOV-1998, results of PCR analysis from an endotracheal specimen were positive for vaccine strain varicella zoster virus. It was also reported that the patient recovered and was discharged. The patient had a history of reactive airway disease and the physician believed the patient had been on a course of steroids 10 days prior to vaccination. The patient ""did have a rash on admission however, it was not severe. However, the patient did decompensate quickly from a respiratory perspective and required intubation with ventilator assist. The patient required ventilatory support for approximately 6 weeks. The physician did not know if the patient acquired a noseomial infection while on the ventilator which would have complicated the patient's course."" Further additional information indicated that the child has ""severe cerebral palsy (due to an abruption at birth)."" The child is competely homebound and requires total care. Also, his concomitant therapy at the time of vaccination included Tegretol, Clonopine, Rhinocort and albuterol. It was reported that the patient ""has a long term history of intermitent steroid use due to his severe reactive airway disease, but he was not actually on steroids at the time of vaccination. ""As of of 08-OCT-1998 the patient was in the middle of a steroid taper, which was completed on approximately 15-OCT-1998. On 22-OCT-1998 the child ""had been off steroids for a week and was vaccinated with VARIVAX. "" He started again on steroids on 29-OCT-1998 and on 09-NOV-1998 he presented to the doctor's office with lesions and subsequently was hospitalized due to VZV pneumonia. Follow-up information from a physician reported that on 22-OCT-1998, the patient was vaccinated with a dose of Influenza virus vaccine. In addition, it was reported that the patient was hospitalized from 09-NOV-1998 through 02-JAN-1999. While hospitalized, the patient received three transfusions. Subsequently, the patient recovered. Additional follow-up information from a physician reported that the patient's usual dose of steroid was 1-2 mg/kg/day (2 tsps BID) of Pediapred. On 29-OCT-1998, the patient was again started on 1-2 mg/kg/day (2 tsps) of Pediapred twice daily for 5 days. Subsequently in October 2003, the patient's experience was also reported in a published literature article.

Concomitant medication: tetanus vaccine administered on 03-Mar-99 and Beconase nasal spray. On 03-Mar-99 the patient received the first .5 cc dose of LYMERIX and the unspecified dose of tetanus vaccine. Twelve days later, on 15-Mar-99, the patient experienced pain in knees, ankles, and wrists, and was seen by a physician. He was treated with ibuprofen 400 mg bid on 15-Mar-99. On 26-Mar-99 his ibuprofen dosage was increased to 600 mg bid. Nine days later, on 24-Mar-99, the patient developed inflamatory polyarthritis and plantar fascitis. Testing has not revealed a specific diagnosis. As of 21-May-99, the patient stated that he was doing well; He had some slight discomfort in his right ankle. He compared it to the feeling one would have had after having sprained an ankle several months ago. It has not kept him from doing anything. He did not think that any joint were swollen, ad, or warm. he no longer had significant heel pain. He was back to work full-time and was taking no medications. Examination showed no swollen joints, including the righ ankle. He was no longer tender under the heels. Impression: acute inflamatory arthritis and plantar fascitis, resolved.

Patient also had a ""constant"" headache and weak grip. The vaccinee stated that these symptoms were caused by ""medication"". The vaccinee had positive myofascial restrictions, normal upper and lower extremity range of motion, and normal ankle strength. May 30, 2000 physical therapy report: the vaccinee received six sessions of physical therapy. Treatment protocol consisted of soft tissue techniques, range of motion, stretching, moist heat, ""E-stim"", paraffin to bilateral hands, home exercise program, and a comprehensive stretching and strengthening pool program. At discharge, the vaccinee reported good/bad days. Pain complaints fluctuated in intensity and region. Objectively, active range of motion was normal throughout all tested regions. Gross strength was within functional limits. Special testing revealed scoliosis. Myofascial restrictions were significant throughout T/&/L/S (thoracic and lumbar spine) At discharge, the vaccinee was encouraged to manage her condition with stretching and strengthening, including a pool program. It was recommended that patient perform light impact activities, i.e. walking, swimming, for cardiovascular fitness. Recommendation: discharge with home exercises program.

Please note that the events of ""lumpy breast mass"" and ""Bartholin abscess"" were not reported as adverse events due to vaccine administration, but were found during the course of review of the patient's health records. Therefore they are not listed as adverse events. As of June 12, 2001, the outcome of the events is unknown.

Additional information was received from a newpaper reporter.  Concurrent medical conditions included severe premenstrual syndrome, fluid retention, penicillin allergy, family history of rheumatoid arthritis, arthritic pain in fingers and knee caps when taking MEGACE and ALDACTARIDE in 1987, and flu-like symptoms while taking ALDACTARIDE in 1987.  Aldactaride was discontinued on 04 June 1987.  Surgical history included two full-term ceserean sections and tubal ligation.  On 04 May 1999, the patient received her first 30 mcg injection of LYMERIX.  Approximately one to two weeks later, the patient reportedly experienced joint pain in her hips, knees, and ankles; flu-like symptoms; ankle edema; swollen feet; a viral syndrome, and stifness (NOS).  She ""could scarcely walk up and down stairs.""  The patient reported that she saw a rheumatologist and underwent unspecified blood tests and x-rays.  The patient stated that the rheumatologist said she had ""reactive arthritis"".  Medical records from the patient's gynecologist and gynecoendocrinologist indicated that the patient was complaining of multiple arthralgias at a 06 May 1999 office visit.  Antinuclear antibody titer and rheumatoid factor measured on 17 May 1999 were negative.  The patient had elevated eosinophils 7.4% (normal, 0-5%), elevated monocytes 600/cubic millimter (normal, 0-590/cubic millimeter), and elevated globulins 3.4 gm/dL (normal, 1.3-3.4 gm/dL).  The symptoms were treated with an anti-inflammatory (NOS), steroids, CELEBREX 100 mg twice daily for 1.5 weeks, and RELAFEN 750 mg every 12 hours. The information received on 09 June 1999 reported the pain was less severe, but the swelling presisted.  The informatoin received on 31 January 2001 did not provide an outcome.  In a news article published 25 June 2001, a reporter stated, ""The stiffness and swelling has become so severe that she is dependent on anti-inflammatory drugs to keep her mobile.""  The patient stated, ""I just keep moving.  It doesn't get rid of the pain, but it keeps me from stiffening."" The outcomes of the flu-like symptoms and viral syndrome were not provided.  The adverse events of reactive arthritis and joint pain do not meet ICH serious criteria, but are being submitted as an expedited report by special FDA request per the June 28, 2000 letter.  Follow up information received July 17, 2001. In 1977, the patient began to experience discomfort in legs. Atrophy of the lateral aspect of her right thigh was noted. Although patient is left-handed and left-side dominant, her left thigh was smaller than her right thigh. The physician stated, ""lesion may be bilateral.""

Allergic to penicillin. No medical history, or concomitant medications. No illness at the time of vaccination. On unspecified dates, the patient received the first and second IM-left deltoid doses of LYMERIX for prevention of Lyme disease. The patient experienced possible Arthus phenomenon on a total of four occasions within a few hours after both LYMERIX doses, respectively. Tics were on for a short period of time (1-6 hours) producing this phenomenon. A long lasting reaction (local reaction weeks up to more than one month at injection site) was experienced. The patient developed a localized area of induration without fever, chills, or arthritis. He also experienced erythema migrans, and intense itching. Patient stated that he had imperfect protection with LYMERIX. The physcian/consumer attributed this reaction to LYMERIX but when it was pointed out that the chance of being bitten by four infected ticks at the same time was extremely small, he realized that this was not probable, and concluded that these were local reactions to a tick bite possibly due to a reaction to tick saliva but probably not true Arthus reactions and not related to LYMERIX. The patient's physician stated that symptoms had an incomplete resolution. There is still itching at the sites.

She developed 2 infections as a result of scratching the rash. The patient has been taking prednisone since 1996 for the rash, and is currently being treated with ultraviolet light therapy which ""seems to be helping a bit"". This patient was recently diagnosed with an allergy to thimerosal. The patient also reported this event to a local health regulatory agency (Ref. no. U1999-00347). She told the agency that she was immunized in the fall of 1995. She also told the agency that thimerosal allergy was diagnosed by skin bispsy and patch testing. she said she had a past history of hepatitis (type not specified). Altough she specifically told Wyeth-Ayerst that she had received no vaccines within 4 weeks of FLU SHIELD, she told the agency that she had received tetanus toxoid and pneumococcal vaccine within 4 weeks of FLU SHIELD.

At the time of the event, the patient had allergic rhinitis and asthma with her triggers being excerise, strong fumes and animals. She was taking inital two puffs three times a day, and Proventil Inhaler on an as needed basis. On an unspecified date, the patient received her first injection with ENGERIX-B. On 08-Dec-1998, the patient received her second injection of ENGERIX-B 0.5 ml for prophylaxis for school regulations. She also received her MMR injection at the same time. Approximtely 15 minutes later the patient became short of breath and had symptoms of wheezing and was taken to the hospital via an automobile. While in the automobile, her wheezing worsened and her mother stated that she passed out. She was noted to be hypotensive upon arrival and developed petechiae and a spasmotic cough and urticaria. The patient was hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit from 08-Dec-1998 to 09-Dec-1998. A hospital discharge summary is not available. The eventual diagnosis made on 08-Dec-1998 was an anaphylactic reaction. The patient was treated for the event with intravenous steroids, epinephrine and intravenous fluids. The most recent information received on 09-Dec-1998 reports the outcome of the patient as recovered and discharged from the hospital. Allergy consultation was performed with the opinion of the chief allergist that the patient had an anaphylactic reaction to either the MMR test or ENGERIX-B vaccination. Allergy testing of both these vaccinations was not to be performed at this time. If further doses were to be given, testing would be done at a future time. Skin testing was done and was positive for cockroach, dust mites, grasses, weeds and molds. Testing for egg by both RAST and skin was negative.",,,Y,Y,Y,2,,,Y,12/08/1998,12/08/1998,0,,UNK,UNK,Naldecon DX;Amoxicillin;Intal;Proventil;,,"allergic rhinitis, asthma, URI;allergic rhinitis & asthma w/some day & noc time coughing;no food allergies;birth history is unremarkable;no somkers or pets in home;",,19980299811,1,,,,,

His hearing fluctuates. Grommets were inserted in ears in 12/89, further testing was normal. Pt was retested 7/24/91 and was found to have reduced hearing again. At this same time the pt was not eating very well. He has a language delay. Mental examination revealed a 4-year old boy who appeared to be functioning at an 8-month-old level in all areas except locomotion. He did not appear to have a social deficit which is described in autism, eye contact was good and he would smile and play some baby games. No evidence of avoidance behavior. A child psychiatrist summarized his finding and felt the pt had a general developmental delay in all areas except locomotion. He didn't feel the child fit the category of childhood autism, but thinks th pt could be classified as having atypical autism which is the other term used for children with mental retardation with autistic features. Additional follow-up information from a foreign legal firm reported that the pt's parents completed an annual educational review of their son's progress for 1999. The parents note that there has not been change in their son's general health such as fitness, eating and sleeping habits, diet or medication. They felt that their son is generally happy and is able to cope better in crown situations and that his moods are more settled. The child uses photographs of places while their family is out and about.
