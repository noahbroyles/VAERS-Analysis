Concurrent conditions and medical history were not reported. On an unknown date, the patients were vaccinated with a dose of GARDASIL (Lot number, expiration date, dose and frequency were not provided). Concomitant medication was not reported. The reporter stated that the patients experienced any of the following events: carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility. The outcome of carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility was unknown at the time of reporting. The reporter did not assess the relatedness between GARDASIL and the aforementioned events. Upon internal review, the event of Carcinogenesis was considered as other important medical event.

Information regarding the patient's medical history, drug reactions or allergies, concurrent conditions and concomitant medications was not provided.    On an unknown date, the patients were vaccinated with quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) (indication, strength, frequency, dose, route, anatomical location, lot # and expiration date were not provided) for prophylaxis.         On an unknown date, numerous deaths were associated with vaccination with quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL). Over 8000 adverse reaction and unspecified number of dramatic side effects were were associated with vaccination with quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL). It was mentioned that quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) affect ovarian function and that can cause female patients to experienced adverse events that had not been expected, in addition it was also stated that might be a connection between vaccination with quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL) and a very severe premature ovarian failure which was further described as premature menopause where the ovaries stop working, no more oocytes mature and where the woman in question becomes infertile. According to the article, since 2006, 213 reports were published regarding amenorrhea and ovarian failure and that 88% of these were linked to vaccination with quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6,11,16,18) recomb. vaccine(GARDASIL). The outcome of death was reported as fatal.

A 32-years-old non pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW3143), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jun2021 as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid function test abnormal, suppressed lactation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing , suspected covid-19 from 02Apr2020 to 16Apr2020.The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. Patient is not currently breastfeeding. Not had a COVID-19 test. Patient has not tested positive for COVID-19 since having the vaccine. Patient is not enrolled in clinical trial. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included anti-muellerian hormone level was normal on , blood follicle stimulating hormone was normal on , blood luteinising hormone was peak, laboratory test was normal on all numbers were normal , thyroid function test was normal. On an unspecified date the patient experienced cycle irregularity, social infertility, light spotting, pregnancy. On 01Jul2021 anovulation. On 17Jun2021 spotting between menses. Events were consider as medical significant. Patient had the vaccine on CD10 of my previous cycle and ovulated on CD14 as normal and began spotting on CD19 and continued spotting for the remainder of her 28 day cycle. Patient period then came as usual on 28Jun, but this cycle had also been irregular. she had high OPK readings for 9 days (rather than my usual 4) and still hadn't ovulated or had a peak LH reading by CD17 when her norm peak LH reading was CD11-13 with ovulation on CD12-14. At this stage her earliest ovulation would be CD19 though it was looking like an anovulatory cycle. She also had very light spotting from CD15-17. patient had 6 years of data on her period and had never in those 6 cycles had spotting earlier than one day before her period or later than one day after it ended. she had perfectly regular 28-30 day cycles with ovulation occurring on CD12-14 in the eight cycles she had tracked ovulation prior to starting unmedicated IUI this summer to deal with social infertility (in a same sex marriage). The irregularities in her cycle had meant they had to cancel our IUI for at least this month and postpone until her cycle irregularity resolves itself. They had to consult our fertility clinic and have an appointment with the doctor to make this decision, so this had resulted in her requiring medical care and postponing medical treatment (our IUI). Patient was also unlikely to get a second vaccine until after she had concluded fertility treatment and likely after any resulting pregnancy was completed. Events considered as medically significant as per reporter. The outcome of events was not resolved.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.|1510410 |

The patient's past medical history included appendectomy (Unecessary appendectomy).   On 15th September 1993, the patient received Hepatitis B vaccine (parenteral). On an unknown date, unknown after receiving Hepatitis B vaccine, the patient experienced endometriosis (serious criteria hospitalization, disability and other: Serious as per reporter), midcycle bleeding (serious criteria hospitalization, disability and other: Serious as per reporter), pain (serious criteria hospitalization, disability and other: Serious as per reporter) and fertility decreased (serious criteria hospitalization, disability and other: Serious as per reporter). On an unknown date, the outcome of the endometriosis was not recovered/not resolved and the outcome of the midcycle bleeding, pain and fertility decreased were unknown.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the endometriosis, midcycle bleeding, pain and fertility decreased to be related to Hepatitis B vaccine.
