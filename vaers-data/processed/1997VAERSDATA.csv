Information has been received from a physician concerning a 28-year-old female with no allergies and history of one previous pregnancy and one previous live birth, who had never had chickenpox as a child and who on 21 Jan 97, one week after her last menstrail period was vaccinated with the first dose of VARICELLA vaccine SC after having been exposed to chickenpox. One week after the vaccination, the patient developed a raised, pimple-like rash, which lasted approximately three days. The patient did not have symptoms of chickenpox or shingles after the vaccination. Subsequently, urine tests confirmed pregnancy (LMP 10 Jan 97). The estimated date of delivery is 17 Oct 97. The second dose of VARICELLA vaccine was not administered. Ultrasounds on 22 May 97 (at 18.8 weeks) and 01 Oct 97 (at 37.5 weeks) were normal. Medication during the pregnancy included prenatal vitamins. On 03 Oct 97, at 38 weeks from her LMP, the patient delivered a seven pound-five ounce normal liveborn female infant. It was noted the infant did not have any complications, congential abnormalities, chickenpox or shingles, and no features of congential varicella syndrome. No further details were provided.

Information has been received from a man concerning his 36-year-old Caucasian wife who on 13FEB97, at 15 weeks of pregnancy, was vaccinated with VARIVAX instead of VZIG. It was noted that the patient and her son were exposed to another child who developed chickenpox, and she took her son to the pediatrician's office for administration of VARIVAX. The pediatrician consulted with the woman's obstetrician, who recommended that she receive VZIG, since she was seronegative. At the pediatrician's office, the woman was inadvertently administered VARIVAX. In February 1997, she developed swelling, redness and soreness at the injection site. At the time of the report, the patient had no other adverse experience. An amniocentesis was performed at 18 weeks of pregnancy for routine evaluation of risk for chromosome aberrations based on maternal age, and not based on perceived risk from the vaccination, according to a physician. At 28 weeks, an ultrasound was normal. During the pregnancy, the patient was placed on therapy with ZOVIRAX. The estimated date of delivery was 04AUG97. On 04AUG97, the woman delivered by scheduled Cesarean ection a healthy son with an Apgar score of 9.9. No further details were provided. This is a correct report.

Concommitant therapy included PPD skin test. It was reported that the patient experienced fever and fussiness for 48 hours following the vaccination. On Mary 4, 1997, ""soon after shot"", the patient developed warmth in left leg, and refused to stand, walk, or bear weight on the left leg. There was ""no apparent reaction at the vaccine site"". The patient was seen by a physician on Mary 6, 1997. The patient was not sleeping well at night, and would not walk since the time of the vaccination. The patient began to crawl again on March 6, 1997. There was no redness, swelling or induration at the injection site. The patient had no range of motion in hips or knee, but moved lower extremities equally in supine. Patient would flex leg at the hip and knee but there was no way to get patient to put foot down on the floor. The physician questioned whether this could be a neuropathy, and thought it could be a reaction to the varicella vaccine. The patient also developed eczema consisting of red raised bumps in the diaper area on March 9, 1997. Also, she was dragging her left foot when walking. The patient was seen again by a physician on March 10, 1997, at which time the patient was crawling. The patient began to bear weight and walk when using a push toy for balance. However, the patient did not lift right foot off the ground, but dragged it. Patient dragged the dorsum of fore foot on the ground and then moved into a plantar stance again. The patient did not pick left foot up off the ground very much, and was slightly pronating ankle. The patient seemed ""a little weak"", but did not seem to be any pain or distress. Her condition seemed improved since the time of the previous office visit, but she was ""a long way"" from her condition prior to vaccination. It was noted that the patient did not need the push toy for balance prior to the varicella vaccine; patient had been walking independently with good balance. The patient was seen on March 20, 1997, at which time her balance was still poor. Patient received physical therapy. Left leg was slightly weaker. As of March 21, 1997, the eczema persisted. Patient was being treated with hydrocortisone at that time. It was noted ""slow but definite improvement to date."" Follow-up information reported that the patient was seen on June 2, 1997 for 15-month well child check up. The physician noted that the patient had completely recovered. This is an amended report. The adverse event terms were changed from eczema, sleeping disorder, and warm sensation to atopic dermatitis, insomnia, and skin warm to touch. The recovery status was updated to yes.

Information has been received from a consumer, the patient's mother, concerning an 18-month old white patient with possible allergies to amoxicillin (*) clavulanate potassium (Augmentin). A history of eczema and eczema at the time of vaccination who on March 18, 1997 was vaccinated subcutaneously (also reported as intravenously) in the left arm with a first does of varicella virus vaccine live (lot # 619674/1544D) Concomitant vaccination on the same day included a fourth dose in the right leg of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (lot #7681484) and a fourth dose in the right arm of haemophilus influenza type B vaccine (Hibtiter) (lot # 14035PE). On the day of the vaccination, the patient developed a spot at the injection site which persisted until ""at least"" April 26, 1997. On May 12, 1997, the patient was bitten by a tick. She became very fussy. On May 14, 1997, the patient developed a fever. On May 18, 1997, the patient was seen by a physician. On May 28, 1997, the patient was placed on therapy with amoxicillin which she had previously taken without any adverse event. The patient developed a fever again that day to 102-103 degrees F. On May 30, 1997, the patient was sleeping a lot, did not have any appetite, and vomited. On May 31, 1997, the patient developed a ""red bubbly pinpoint"" rash at the injection site and on her trunk, ears, and around her torso that then spread down her back. Therapy with amoxicillin 'which could have caused the rash' was discontinued on June 2, 1997. Follow-up information was received from a physician. The patient was seen by the physician on June 3, 1997 at which time the rash was gone. From June 2, 1997 to June 10, 1997 the patient spent a lot of time with grandfather and the physician noted that the child may have had exposure to the wild type virus during the first two weeks of June. On June 4, 1997, a blood sample was tested for ""mono"" and Lyme disease with results unknown. Laboratory evaluation revealed that the patient was slightly anemic. The patient's physician did not think the rash was related to vaccination. It was noted that there were no adverse events following prior vaccination. At the time of the report, it was unknown if the patient recovered. Follow-up information was received from the patient's mother. On May 4, 2003 at the age of 7 years the patient began to break out into a rash with ""tiny blister dots"" that spread to the neck area. On May 5, 2003, the patient woke in the middle of the night crying that her ear hurt. The ear was very red and swollen. The mother called the patient's doctor who did not believe it was shingles. It was noted that there was no concomitant medication. The doctor prescribed prednicarbate (DERMATOP) and azithromycin (Zithromax). At the time of the report, the rash, ear pain, ear redness and ear swelling had not abated.  It was noted that a product quality complaint was not involved. The initial reported indicated the patient's grandfather experienced shingles (WAES #97091735).",,,,Y,,,,,U,03/18/1997,03/18/1997,0,4JUN97 blood sample was tested for mono & lyme disease w/results unk;,PVT,PVT,,Eczema; drug hypersensitivity,Varicella exposure; eczema.,,WAES97061242,1,,,,,
